* **Test Number 1: Search Related Test Case.** I decided to create a search related test case to check if data can be inputed in the text field and to check the search response time.

* **Test Number 2: Sign-up Related Test Case.** The reason why I created a sign up related test case was to check the behavior of the form by adding random data to the text fields. In addition, assuring that the sign up button is working.


* **Test Number 3: Login Related Test Case.** I created the One login related test case to verify that users already signed up to the website were able to login on the Login page.


* **Test Number 4: Product Demo Related Test Case.** I created the schedule a product demo related test case to verify that users are able to sign up for a demo. In addition, I ensured that users were able to click the check mark to receive emails about Moat Products, Services, and Events.
